## 1595 - Symmetry
### Collin Franklin
### Description:

Write a program that determines whether a figure, drawn with dots, is left-right symmetric or not.
The dots are all distinct.
### Input
The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases T is given in the first line of the input file.
The first line of each test case contains an integer N , where N (1 ≤ N ≤ 1, 000) is the number of dots
in a figure. Each of the following N lines contains the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of a dot. Both
x-coordinates and y-coordinates are integers between −10, 000 and 10, 000, both inclusive.
### Output
Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain ‘YES’ if the figure is left-right symmetric,
and ‘NO’, otherwise.
