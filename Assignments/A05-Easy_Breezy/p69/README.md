## Problem 69 - LeetCode

### Method for Completing

This code is calculating the square root of a number x using Newton's method, which is an efficient iterative approach.
The method starts with an initial guess and improves the guess iteratively using the Newton-Raphson formula.
After a fixed number of iterations (100 in this case), the method returns the floored value of the approximation, effectively giving the integer square root of x.
