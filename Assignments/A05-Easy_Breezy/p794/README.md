## Problem 794 - LeetCode

### Method for Completing

The function validates a Tic-Tac-Toe board based on the following criteria:

    'X' and 'O' counts must be reasonable (either 'X' is equal to or one more than 'O').
    The winner rules must be followed (only one winner is allowed, and the counts must match the game rules).
    If the board passes all checks, it returns True, indicating a valid configuration. Otherwise, it returns False.
