## Problem 9 - LeetCode

### Method for Completing

str(x):

    This converts the integer x into a string.
    For example, if x = 121, str(x) gives the string '121'.

[::-1] (String Slicing):

    The slice notation [::-1] is used to reverse the string.
    So, if x = 121, str(x)[::-1] gives '121' in reversed form, which is also '121'.

Comparison:

    The function compares the original string representation of x (str(x)) with its reversed version (reversed_str).
    If they are equal (i.e., the original number is the same when read backwards), the number is a palindrome.

Return Value:

    If the original string and the reversed string are the same, the function returns True, indicating that the number is a palindrome.
    If they are not equal, the function returns False.
